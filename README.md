# Graph Algorithms
This repository contains graph algorithms made in golang by Lars M Bek and Ida M Jensen

The repository contains the following algorthms:
* Dijkstra (currently only n^2 time complexity version)

Information about the code:
* The code's test coverage is 100%
* The code style is interface driven
  * The Go code follows an interface-driven design, where interfaces define behavior and decouple implementations, promoting flexibility, testability, and modularity. This approach ensures that dependencies are injected via interfaces, enabling easy swapping of implementations for testing or future scalability.
